# Signify signing key for signed file include macros

# Preproc and postproc macro definitions
# macro_name = "value"[:append|substitute]
# Macro names can contain alphanumeric characters or - and _
# All macros are preproc macros, which can be referenced in match and
# exclude rules using %%macro_name%%.
# They are optionally postproc macros, which means the macro name will
# either be appended to the value when it appears in output, or
# substituted for the value when it appears in output.
# Macros are intended to be used for commonly used tokens such as
# IP and MAC addresses, public key identifiers, etc., that are used
# across many rules and may change from time to time (preproc) and/or
# are not clear/human-readable in output (postproc).
# Macros are parsed as regular expressions, so the following characters
# should be escaped with backslashes: plus, slash, period, asterisk,
# parentheses, left and right brackets.
# A macro value can be included from a file in same dir as config
# file using the format
#  macro_name = "<file:filename>"
# If a file contains multiple lines they will be concatenated with "|".
# To require that the file in question be signed with a signify key
# specified in the signify_pubkey directive, which must appear prior
# to the macro, use
#  macro_name = "<signedfile:filename>"
# The signature must be in filename.sig in the same dir as the config file.

# For each log to monitor, give the following:
# log: [<logpath>]
# match: [all|/<regexp>/] (default all)
# exclude: [none|/<regexp>/] (default none)
# frequency: [all|daily|hourly] (default all)
# action: [notify <email>|text <email>|alert] (default notify [master_notify email])
# Multiple sets of match/exclude/action directives can be specified
# for each log.
# notify requires one or more email addresses (separated by commas), which
# will be sent a report.
# text requires one or more email addresses (separated by commas), which
# will be sent the raw logs (e.g., for text messaging).
# alert takes no additional arguments and displays output directly
# to STDOUT.

# Can define settings for multiple hosts in one file shared across multiple
# systems by using:
# hosts: [<host name list, space separated>]
# to identify which sections apply to which hosts.
