# Signify signing key for signed file include macros

# Preproc and postproc macro definitions
# macro_name = "value"[:append|substitute]
# Macro names can contain alphanumeric characters or - and _
# All macros are preproc macros, which can be referenced in match and
# exclude rules using %%macro_name%%.
# They are optionally postproc macros, which means the macro name will
# either be appended to the value when it appears in output, or
# substituted for the value when it appears in output.
# Macros are intended to be used for commonly used tokens such as
# IP and MAC addresses, public key identifiers, etc., that are used
# across many rules and may change from time to time (preproc) and/or
# are not clear/human-readable in output (postproc).
# Macros are parsed as regular expressions, so the following characters
# should be escaped with backslashes: plus, slash, period, asterisk,
# parentheses, left and right brackets.
# A list of macros can be included from a file in the same dir as config
# file using the directive:
#     macro-include-file: filename
# or  macro-include-signedfile: filename
# The latter of which must be signed with a signify key specified in the
# signify_pubkey directive, which must appear prior to the macro include
# directive. The context of the included macros (global or host) is the
# same as if the included file contents were at the same position in the
# config file.
# Possible use case: TLS certificate key fingerprints observed,
# using substitute or append options, for enrichment.
#
# A macro value can also be included from a file for macros defined either
# directly in the config file or via include files. They must also be in
# the same dir as the config file and are specified using the format
#  macro_name = "<file:filename>"
# If a macro value file contains multiple lines they will be
# concatenated with "|".
# To require that the file in question be signed with a signify key
# specified in the signify_pubkey directive, which must appear prior
# to the macro, use
#  macro_name = "<signedfile:filename>"
# The signature must be in filename.sig in the same dir as the config file.
# Possible use case: commonly observed domains in DNS queries, to exclude
# from matches and identify newly observed domains.

# For each log to monitor, give the following:
# log: [<logpath>]
# match: [all|/<regexp>/] (default all)
# exclude: [none|/<regexp>/] (default none)
# frequency: [all|daily|hourly] (default all)
# action: [notify <email>|text <email>|alert] (default notify [master_notify email])
# Multiple sets of match/exclude/action directives can be specified
# for each log.
# notify requires one or more email addresses (separated by commas), which
# will be sent a report.
# text requires one or more email addresses (separated by commas), which
# will be sent the raw logs (e.g., for text messaging).
# alert takes no additional arguments and displays output directly
# to STDOUT.

# Can define settings for multiple hosts in one file shared across multiple
# systems by using:
# hosts: [<host name list, space separated>]
# to identify which sections apply to which hosts.
# Old style multi-host configs are also still supported using:
# begin-host: [<hostname>]
# and
# end-host: [<hostname>]
# but that style requires significant redundancy for similarly configured
# systems. The two styles cannot be mixed.
